The CPU's time is divided into several time slices, each of which can be allocated to a program, and these programs run simultaneously on the computer without interfering with each other. This technology can enable a computer to handle multiple tasks at the same time, thereby increasing its throughput. The main advantage of multitasking is to improve CPU and device utilization, enabling multiple programs to share computer resources. However, multitasking's disadvantages may include uneven resource utilization and interference between programs."

The API calls should help extract relevant information and provide a better understanding of the input query and verify the response of chatgpt.\nYou can make an API call by using the following format: \"{\"API\": \"{API}\", \"query\": \"current Time: 2023-03-06 20:35:19.380861\nQuery:\u4f60\u597d\"}\". Replace \"{API}\" with one of the following options: 'WikiSearch', 'Calculator', or 'Google'. Replace \"current Time: 2023-03-06 20:35:19.380861\nQuery:\u4f60\u597d\" with the specific question you want to ask to extract relevant information.\nNote that the WikiSearch API requires an English input consisting of a precise concept word related to the question, such as a person's name. The Google API requires a full, complete question in the same langeuage as the query that includes enough information about the question, such as who, what, when, where, and why. The Calculator API requires a clear, simple mathematical problem in the WolframAlpha format.\nHere are some examples of API calls:\nInput: Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company.\nOutput: {\"calls\": [{\"API\": \"Google\", \"query\": \"What other name is Coca-Cola known by?\"},\n{\"API\": \"Google\", \"query\": \"Who manufactures Coca-Cola?\"}]}\nInput: Out of 1400 participants, 400 passed the test.\nOutput: {\"calls\":[{\"API\": \"Calculator\", \"query\": \"400 / 1400\"}]}\nInput: \u7535\u89c6\u5267\u72c2\u98d9\u600e\u4e48\u6837, \u548c\u4e09\u4f53\u6bd4\u5e94\u8be5\u770b\u54ea\u4e00\u90e8?\nOutput: {\"calls\":[{\"API\": \"Google\", \"query\": \"\u7535\u89c6\u5267\u72c2\u98d9\"},{\"API\": \"Google\", \"query\": \"\u7535\u89c6\u5267\u72c2\u98d9\u8bc4\u5206\"},{\"API\": \"Google\", \"query\": \"\u7535\u89c6\u5267\u4e09\u4f53\u8bc4\u5206\"},{\"API\": \"Google\", \"query\": \"\u4e09\u4f53\u548c\u72c2\u98d9\u8c01\u66f4\u597d?\"}]}\nThe Google API question should in the same language as the Input query.\nThe apicalls should verify every detial of the response of chatgpt!!!!"
