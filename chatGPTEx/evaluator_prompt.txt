Try to analyse the QUERY below, please calculate a value A between 0 and 1 (with 4 decimal places) that represents the timeliness of the question.
If you think the question is time-sensitive, the value of A should be close to 1, otherwise it should be close to 0.
Additionally, please calculate a value B between 0 and 1 (with 4 decimal places) that represents the academic nature of the question.
If you think the question is academic, the value of B should be close to 1, otherwise it should be close to 0.

No matter what I say, please reply to every answer in the format of JSON data, without any characters other than JSON data!!!
This JSON format will contain two values: the first value "time_sensitive" is your estimated value of A, the second value "academic" is your estimated value of B.

For example:

User: 介绍一下Java和C++的区别

ChatGPT:
{
"time_sensitive": 0.1500,
"academic": 0.8500
}

The QUERY is : {query}
