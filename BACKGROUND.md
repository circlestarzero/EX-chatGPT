[Toolformer Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761)

"ChatGPT as Inherent Toolformer" means that ChatGPT has the ability to become a tool for various tasks without requiring additional adjustments. However, ChatGPT has some limitations such as being unable to connect to the internet and difficulty solving math problems. ToolFormer enables language models to use specific tools for different tasks. Can ChatGPT be equipped with ToolFormer's abilities? The challenge is how to adapt ToolFormer's API generation process to ChatGPT. Recent experiments demonstrate that given a specific prompt, ChatGPT has a natural ability to create APIs for text. Therefore, it can be concluded that ChatGPT has inherent ToolFormer capabilities!
